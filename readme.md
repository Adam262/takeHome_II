The assignment should be completed without using any third party JavaScript and CSS frameworks/polyfills.

Create a login form that is centered horizontally and vertically using CSS that accepts the following:
Email Address
Password
Submit button

Each input should have a placeholder attribute along with a Javascript fallback to handle older versions of Internet Explorer (8/9).

Write a validation function that binds to the form and uses class names to inform the validator as to how each input should be validated when the form is submitted.

Use the following validation rules:
Email address - required and is a valid email address
Password - required, must contain at least one lowercase character, one uppercase character and one number
