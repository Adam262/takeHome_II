**The attached code contains my answers to a take home coding challenge**

*Instructions*

  +  Create a login form that is centered horizontally and vertically using CSS that accepts the following:
        +   Email Address
        +   Password
        +   Submit button
  +   Write a validation function that binds to the form and uses class names to inform the validator as to how   each input should be validated when the form is submitted.

  +   Use the following validation rules:
        +   Email address - required and is a valid email address
        +   Password - required, must contain at least one lowercase character, one uppercase character and one number

  +     The assignment should be completed without using any third party JavaScript and CSS frameworks/polyfills.

  *Challenges*
  +     Developing a regex to validate the password;
  +     Accessing the elements returned on the nodeList. The list is an array of elements; array notation is necessary;
  +     Vertical alignment of a block displayed element. There is no one native CSS property for this operation; display:table is a bit of a hack that works;
